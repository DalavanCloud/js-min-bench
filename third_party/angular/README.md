# Angular sample app

This is extracted from Angular 5's autogenerated basic app, which was generated
using Angular CLI version 1.6.3.

## Reconstructing the JS

```sh
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
$ ng new hello
$ cd hello
$ ng eject --target=production
$ edit webpack.config.js
### apply the changes in config.patch, which remove chunk splitting and uglify.
$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack
$ cp dist/main.*.js ../main.js
$ rm -rf hello  # >250mb!
```
